\mysection{Learning to Attend for Tracking}



The model is optimised for the following three objectives.
\begin{description}[leftmargin=\parindent,labelsep=1em]
	
	\item[Main Tracking Objective:] Maximise the overlap of predicted box with the true object.
	
	\item[Spatial Attention:] The glimpse should contain the object, but shouldn't be too big.
	
	\item[Appearance Attention:] The dynamic appearance features should respond specifically to the target object.
	
	
\end{description}
